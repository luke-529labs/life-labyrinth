# Development Log

## 2024-07-26

*   **Initial Setup:** Created project structure with `main.py`, `game.py`, `grid.py`, `constants.py`, and `requirements.txt`.
*   **Virtual Environment:** Set up a Python virtual environment (`.venv`) using Anaconda's Python interpreter and installed Pygame.
*   **Core Mechanics MVP:**
    *   Implemented basic Pygame window and game loop.
    *   Created `Grid` and `Tile` classes for representing the game board.
    *   Implemented `Setup Phase` allowing player to place limited initial live cells.
    *   Implemented `Simulation Phase` running standard Conway's Game of Life rules for a fixed number of turns.
    *   Added basic UI elements for phase/turn info and block count.
*   **Gameplay Refactor (Zone-based):**
    *   Removed single start/end tiles.
    *   Introduced `Start Zone` (first few columns) for initial cell placement.
    *   Introduced `Goal Zone` (last column) as the objective.
*   **Persistence Mechanic:**
    *   Implemented rule where cells reaching the `Goal Zone` become `persistent`.
    *   Persistent cells ignore standard death rules.
    *   Persistence spreads to adjacent live cells via BFS.
*   **Simulation Enhancements:**
    *   Simulation now stops early (loss) if all live cells die.
    *   Added a `Retry` mechanism after simulation ends (win or loss), resetting the level.
    *   Introduced `GAME_OVER_PHASE` for managing the end state.
*   **Documentation:** Updated `docs/feature overview.md` to reflect the current zone-based gameplay and persistence mechanics.
